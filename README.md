In this paper, we present MineVRA (MultImodal generative artificial iNtelligence for contExt-aware Virtual Reality Assets), a novel Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) XR framework that integrates GenAI to facilitate coherent and adaptive 3D content generation in immersive scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a comparative user study analyzing the performance and user satisfaction of GenAI-generated 3D objects compared to those generated by Sketchfab in different immersive contexts. The results suggest that GenAI can significantly complement traditional 3D asset libraries, with valuable design implications for the development of human-centered XR environments.

<!--*<sub>From (1) to (4), each row represents clothes images with different variations. At each row, we partition the images into two groups, the left three columns represent clothes from commercial stores, while the right three columns are from customers.In each group, the three images indicate three levels of difficulty with respect to the corresponding variation.Furthermore, at each row, the items in these two groups of images are from the same clothing identity but from two different domains, that is, commercial and customer.The items of the same identity may have different styles such as color and printing.Each item is annotated with landmarks and masks.*-->
